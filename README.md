Example of composition in Grails GORM. This example is using Grails version 2.3.5. 

The purpose of this project is to showcase how to apply object composition inside Grails domain classes. I wrote a blog post specifically for this purpose, which can be found at this URL: [http://zakirtariverdiev.blogspot.com/2014/02/making-grails-gorm-composition-work.html](http://zakirtariverdiev.blogspot.com/2014/02/making-grails-gorm-composition-work.html "Making Grails Composition Work").
